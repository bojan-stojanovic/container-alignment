# Container alignment
## What is purpose of this?
I had request to make page with multiple containers. Usual use-case is that containers are centred on page. <br>
However, I needed also some containers to start at the left side of page and expand until the end of centred one, and one that starts at the begining of centred one and expand to the end of page.
